This is an **incubator project**, which simplifies working with Hydra from java applications. Hydra is an isomorphic state machine L2 network, which works seamlessly with Cardano.

## Hydra
You can access documentation regarding Hydra here: https://hydra.family/head-protocol/. We recommend especially to follow QuickStart on devnet network (https://hydra.family/head-protocol/docs/getting-started/quickstart) and (https://hydra.family/head-protocol/docs/getting-started/demo/with-docker) as well as reading (https://hydra.family/head-protocol/docs/tutorial/using_hydra/using-hydra-part-3)
